## Experience

### Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago
#### Software Engineering Intern
- Implement automated multi-region disaster recovery using AWS services (EC2, RDS, Route 53) and Terraform for a test application, enabling scheduled and intelligent failover based on resource availability
- Engineer an automatic update process for OSS in an Angular/Spring application, including automated site testing
- Create a proof-of-concept for unit testing PostgreSQL procedures, functions, and triggers using a test application
- Architected critical RESTful APIs using Spring Boot to replace database links, aiding cloud migration effort
- Leveraged Docker, Terraform, Mockito unit tests, and built GitLab CI/CD pipelines for deployment and scalability
- Maintained FedLine Solutions, securing payment services for 100,000 users, moving 5 trillion dollars daily

### The Buoyancy Project (FPVM)
#### Research Contributor
- Design and implement a Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler to translate custom Floating-point Intermediate Representation (FIR) into native x86-64 assembly, achieving near-native execution speeds
- Enhance VM instruction set with x86 comparison, precisely manipulating EFLAGS for complex conditional logic
- Define architectural roadmap for high-performance computing by prototyping 256-bit AVX vector instruction support, detailing kernel state, register file, and compilation pipeline changes

### Prescience Lab (DMPL)
#### Research Assistant
- Scaled functional programming language MaPLe to a distributed memory environment using MPI and C
- Developed efficient parallel garbage collection for MPL, scaling to hundreds of cores and 1TB+ heap sizes
- Optimized whole-program compilation with MLton for performance competitive with C/C++

### Fulminare Holdings
#### Software Engineering Intern
- Wrote programs in Swift for data imports from other apps to improve user transitions to poker bankroll tracker
- Marketed app by creating and maintaining a Twitter bot to post daily threads resulting in an increase of over 8000 app users
- Conducted market research on fitness apps to help inform and provide feedback for new app development
